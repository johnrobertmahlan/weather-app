# John's Weather App

This is a simple weather app that displays two things for any city entered by a user: 

* Current weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, clear, rain, etc.)
* Current temperature (both Fahrenheit and Celsius)

### Wireframe

The initial plan for the app was a little more ambitious than what I ended up with, as I wanted the user to see both the current and upcoming hourly forecasts, and ended up scrapping that due to  time constraints. But the overall aesthetic of what I ended up with remained the same:

### Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (including jQuery)
* Google Fonts

The site is powered by [Open Weather Map's API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### Future Goals

If you watch the weather forecast on the news, the weather is often displayed with small animations to illustrate the forecast. For example, if Friday's forecast calls for rain, then when Friday's forecast is displayed, there will often be a small animation of rain. I would love to have images or animations to illustrate the forecast being displayed by my app.

I would also like to give the user additional options in terms of the *kind* of forecast they'd like to see. Right now, the app displays only the *current* weather. If I were to continue working on the app, I would want the app to display the hourly forecast for the next several hours alongside the current forecast, as well as give the user the option to see the forecasts for the next few days.
